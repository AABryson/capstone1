Superheroes
Create a website that would appeal to someone like my sons.  It would be a superhero website where the user could access different kinds of information related to superheros.  Perhaps create a space for the user to rate different superheros, assess their abilities, even propose alternate endings to parts of their story.

CocktailsDB
This would use the api https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php?ref=apilist.fun.  On this website users can serach for a cocktail and get back relevant information such as the explicit directions for making it, ingredients needed, and possible variations.  Users that don't have a specific cocktail in mind can search for a random cocktail.  Along with this, users can find cocktails by their first letter and search for ingredients by name.  They can filter queries by category, glass type, or whether a drink is alcoholic.  There is also a list of possible categories and glasses to apply as filters.  Finally, users can signup to the website and login.  They can write reviews and specify their favorites.
